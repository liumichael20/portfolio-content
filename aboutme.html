		<p>Hey!  Thanks for checking out my page. 

            I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan in Engineering. I'm studying Computer Science and minoring in Business and Entrepreneurship.
            
            Back home in New York, I loved taking pictures and capturing memories and videos with all my friends. Through different experiences, startups, and projects, I've learned in-depth photography and editing skills. Now, I'm bringing those skills to Michigan's campus.
            
            I'm always excited to meet new people and capture new smiles! Can't wait to meet you!</p>
